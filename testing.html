            The wedding venue is located about 3 hours from Taipei, but no need to worry about the journey—we're offering complimentary transportation from Taipei to Sun Moon Lake on November 23rd. We highly recommend arriving in Taipei before then to take advantage of this service.

            If you prefer to travel independently, the venue is also accessible via the high-speed rail, followed by a scenic 1.5-hour car ride. As the big day approaches, we’ll be in touch to coordinate your travel plans and make sure everything goes smoothly!
